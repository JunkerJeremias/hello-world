Hello World!

This is Albert, I'm all in to C++. That is also pretty much the only language I know and I want to know. Don't have too much time to code right now, so this is all I can do.

Currently I'm trying to learn OpenGL using TheCherno's Vidoes on Youtube and the Book called: "Learn OpenGL - Graphics Programming" by Joey De Vries.
I'm making an OK progress, but having problems finding the time to work on it. I find it easy to follow but hard to remember and use without the help of references.

That's all for now.
Bye


Huh... I wrote this about a year ago. Not much progress regarding OpenGL unfortunately. The job offer I aimed for rejected me so I pretty much lost interest in it.

I'm currently half way through a machine learning course on coursera.org and very keen on finishing it. Apart from that I'm back into Unreal Engine 4 development. Whenever I have time I'm improving and learning about the engine and aim to get a job as a professional.

Till later then.
