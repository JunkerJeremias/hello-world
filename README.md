Hello World!

This is Albert, I'm all in to C++. That is also pretty much the only language I know and I want to know. Don't have too much time to code right now, so this is all I can do.

Currently I'm trying to learn OpenGL using TheCherno's Vidoes on Youtube and the Book called: "Learn OpenGL - Graphics Programming" by Joey De Vries.
I'm making an OK progress, but having problems finding the time to work on it. I find it easy to follow but hard to remember and use without the help of references.

That's all for now.
Bye
